### Description

In this project i made digital clock which is equipped with moslem prayer reminder feature. Thanks to several libraries available, i could make this project come alive. I used NTP (Network Time Protocol) to fetch time through internet. The time and prayer reminder will be displayed using Max7219 8x8 LED Matrix display. <br>
